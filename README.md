Assembly-Language-Bit-Banging-Between-Two-Microcontrollers

This Assembly code allows for two PIC 16F628 Microcontrollers to communicate to each other using a technique called Bit-Banging. A general description of what big-banging is can be found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging.

This code allows a user with two PIC 16F628 Microcontrollers to communicate with each other as well as trigger "events" within the connected chip.

The code here represents the Sender side of the communication. For receiver side code refer to Assemby-Language-Bit-Banging-Between-Two-Microcontrollers-Receiver.
